# Creating modules

# Goal

It may seem simple when you manage one resource, but often in order to deliver some functionality you need to have multiple resources configured. To make it simpler you can use modules. Even managing those VMs will be a lot simpler with a module.


# Success criteria

* Create module for managing vm's - parameters:
  * quantity
  * machine-type
  * name
* Create new VM using module - `name: master`
